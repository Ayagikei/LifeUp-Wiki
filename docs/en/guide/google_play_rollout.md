# 🎯 Google Play Staged Rollout

> 🚀 We ship new builds on Google Play through staged rollout to balance speed and stability.

## 📦 Current Status

- Version: `v1.100.1`
- Coverage: 100% released

## 🆕 What's New

- Check the latest notes in the [Release Log](../ReleaseLog.md).
- If a newer staged build appears, it usually contains fast-follow fixes—watch for store updates.

## 🛠️ Known Issues & Feedback

- Known issues: none at the moment.
- If you run into a problem, email lifeup@ulives.io and include your app version, device info, and steps to reproduce so we can triage quickly.

## ❓ FAQ: Why staged rollout?

- We start with a small percentage of users, then expand after stability is confirmed to reduce the impact of unexpected bugs.
- Please report any issues during the rollout; we will fix and republish as soon as possible.
- Staged builds may include the newest features alongside occasional unexpected behavior. These versions can carry `alpha` / `beta` / `rc` labels and may update more frequently to ship fixes.

> 🧭 “100% released” means the build is fully available to everyone.
