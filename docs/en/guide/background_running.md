# Run in background

## Why

- Some OS will kill the pomodoro reminders when LifeUp in running background or when the phone screen closed.
- LifeUp app widget might not working properly on some home screen app and OS.
- The default reminder method might need LifeUp running in background:
    - you can also consider switching to the system calendar APP reminder (this will require calendar read and write permissions) in the `Settings` - `Tasks Settings` page.
- For MIUI OS, it may restrict the widget from popping up the UI, which will affect the widget to complete the counting task. 



## How

**Warning:** 

These methods may increase the battery draining.

It depends on the OS and use environment.

### Common ways to keep the app running in the background

1. Check your BATTERT options in the system SETTINGS app and disable the battery optimization for LifeUp.
2. Lock LifeUp in your multitasking pane.
3. Enable the `Quick Add notification` in the Task Setting screen.


### Change Reminder

**You can consider switching to the system calendar APP reminder (this will require calendar read and write permissions) in the `Settings` - `Tasks Settings` page.**

After the switching, please check whether the system calendar APP is successfully inserted into the event.

LifeUp is only responsible for inserting events, and subsequent reminders will be implemented by the system calendar APP. Please confirm the relevant configuration of the system calendar APP.
