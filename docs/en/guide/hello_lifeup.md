## Introduction

?> **Thanks for purchasing and downloading *LifeUp*!**



**LifeUp is a unique gamify To-Do and habit forming android application.**

It is different from some gamify app that is incorporated into the built-in game.

It focuses on using game elements to motivate you to act in real life.

You can customize your attributes, rewards, achievements, synthesis, and even treasure chests in LifeUp.

But this also means that the early settings and learning need for a period of time.

One thing to note is that LifeUp is positioned as a to-do list, habit-forming app, not a calendar app.


### FAQ before use

But before your use, you may want to know the following information:

- **I downloaded it through Google Play. If I am not satisfied, how can I get a refund?**

  Both we and Google Play know that an app is difficult to satisfy everyone.

  As long as you uninstall the app within a period of time (usually 24 hours), you can get the
  automatic refund of Google Play.

  If you exceed this time, please contact our mailbox kei.ayagi@gmail.com and provide your GPA order
  number, we will assist with the refund.

- **Is my data privacy and safety?**

  Definitely, We value your privacy!

  You can
  check [our privacy policy documents](https://wiki.lifeupapp.fun/en/#/introduction/privacy-terms)
  to get more information.

  TL;DR: Except for the world module (similar to the function of sharing design), other data will
  not pass through our server, it will only be stored in your device. The same is true of the
  pictures and other information you choose. **You can also choose offline mode.**

- **Since the server does not store data, how can I back up the data?**

  LifeUp supports export and import data functions.

  You can also set up the WebDAV server, Google Drive or Dropbox for automatic backup.

- **Do I have to log in? Or when I log in, it is prompted that the network is abnormal?**

  No! LifeUp is an *offline-first* app.

  Logging in is only used to access the "World" module, which lets you view teams, items, and random
  tasks created by others.

  If you are unable to log in, it may be due to a problem with your local network, or an abnormality
  with our server.

  You can try switching network and DNS first.

  If you think there is a problem with our server, you can send us an email to confirm.

  You can also try using offline mode directly, which will also give you access to most of LifeUp's
  features!

- **How to configure task notifications and background running?**

  LifeUp supports notification and calendar event reminders.

  Due to Android's battery limitations, **and additional aggressive battery optimization measures by some phone manufacturers**, the default notification reminder require additional user configuration to take effect.

  You can also try switching to Calendar Event Reminders, which only requires granting Calendar permissions.

  > *But some other features (like Pomodoro) may also need to be configured to run in the background.

  For more information, please check this document: https://wiki.lifeupapp.fun/en/index.html#/guide/background_running

- **How can I view more FAQs about app usage?**

  You can always find the link of **the FAQ page** in the app-`sidebar`-`Q&A`.

## Features

> ðŸš§We're still working on these documents...

There are a lot of examples and guidelines in the app right now.

For higher customization and more feature support, LifeUp will have a certain threshold for getting
started.

But don't panic, the vast majority of them are optional.

**You can focus only on the options you need with minimal usage.** And gradually learn more options
to unlock more usages.

It's like playing a game and gradually improving your skills! :D
