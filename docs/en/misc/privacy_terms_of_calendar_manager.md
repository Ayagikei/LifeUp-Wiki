## 1. Personal Information

We do not collect any personal information, not even app-related performance information.

## 2. Permissions

### Calendar

The application only applies for calendar read and write permissions, which are used to obtain the
list of calendar accounts and perform delete operations.

### No network permissions required

Operations are all performed locally. Apps do not apply for network permissions, and data is
therefore not transmitted anywhere outside the app.

## 3. Agreement

By using this App you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

You agree that you are responsible for your own data.
