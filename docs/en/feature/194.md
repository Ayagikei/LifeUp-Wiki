## 1. ‚úÖMultiple Item Rewards

![image-20240422223851277](_media/194/image-20240422223851277.png)

Now, in LifeUp, you can select multiple items in various places. You no longer need to set up opening boxes or crafting to achieve multiple rewards.

For example, you can:

- Directly set multiple item rewards for a task
- Choose multiple items when setting up box opening, then set the probabilities all at once
- Directly set multiple item rewards for achievements and subtasks

<br/>

### üìïHow to Use?

Click the multi-select button at the top when selecting items.

> Please note that some scenarios may only support single selection.

## 2. üîßInventory Widgets

![widget_inventory_large_preview](_media/194/widget_inventory_large_preview.png)

This version introduces two sizes of inventory widgets.

Now, you can directly view and quickly use the items in your inventory from your desktop.

<br/>

### üöÄ Optimizations and Problem Solving

Despite launching the store widget several versions ago, we gradually encountered some crashes or other issues.

For instance, due to the widget system's transmission limits, having too many items might cause the app to crash, or list switching issues, or custom image loading failures.

In this version, we have found suitable solutions. Now, store and inventory widgets should be able to display a large number of items, and we have tested store widgets with nearly 1000 items to still be functional and load properly (of course, this is not recommended).

<br/>

### üìïHow to Use?

Usually, you can create a widget by long-pressing the system desktop.

If you are using a device like Xiaomi or Redmi (MIUI/HyperOS), adding widgets in MIUI/HyperOS is somewhat hidden, please consult the compatibility configuration document on how to add widgets.
