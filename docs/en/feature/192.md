Statistics and data review are not only an important step in improving our productivity, but also a source of inspiration and feedback.

By reviewing our efforts, we can see our progress and achievements with data, and also identify issues and areas for improvement.

For this, we have launched [Statistics 2.0], which offers you a variety of intriguing data insights.

### 🏆**New app widgets**

#### Shop list widgets

![image-20230716010549696](_media/192/image-20230716010549696.png)

This update introduces two shop list widgets that are suitable for large and small sizes.

Now you can purchase and use them right on the desktop~

> Note: The current one is the “shop” widget, not the “inventory” widget.
>
> Although it allows you to buy and use items, it doesn’t let you view the items in the “inventory” directly.

<br/>

And this time the shop list is like the task list,

**You can choose different lists for each widget.**

<br/>

If you tap on the background area at the top, you can also quickly jump to the shop page within the app.



#### Daily exp changes widget

![image-20230716010240621](_media/192/image-20230716010240621.png)

With this widget, you can see the summary data of your daily experience value changes on the launcher.

## 🖥️Desktop

### ✨Automatic connection

![image-20230716020210438](_media/192/image-20230716020210438.png)


According to user feedback, filling in the IP is a major factor that hinders users from using the desktop version.

This update brings the function of automatically detecting the IP of LifeUp Cloud Server.

<br/>

The prerequisite for using this function:

- Download v1.3.0 of LifeUp Cloud (you can get it from Google Play updates or our GitHub pages).

You can automatically detect the corresponding IP address on the desktop version, no need to fill it in manually anymore.

> After testing, this feature is currently mainly verified on the Windows side.
>
> MacOS side may not support automatic detection yet.

### 🚀**Export feelings to markdown**

![image-20230716020241251](_media/192/image-20230716020241251.png)

![image-20230716020226764](_media/192/image-20230716020226764.png)

The desktop version now supports exporting feelings as markdown format.

And it supports grouping and exporting in multiple ways, and the impressions will also include complete image attachments.

With the markdown format, you can easily use **third-party tools** to render and convert to pdf, word and other formats again.

------

### **✏️Add task**

![image-20230716020407513](_media/192/image-20230716020407513.png)

With the help of the API capabilities built earlier, the desktop version now supports creating simple tasks.

The current settings have not been able to cover all the options in the app, but they are enough to create simple tasks.

Subsequent versions will also continue to enhance the options for creating tasks and support editing tasks, etc.

------

### 🖥️**MacOS installation package**

Starting from version 1.1.0, we will also start releasing MacOS installation packages.

After a simple test, the functions of the Mac OS version are basically normal.
