## I. Emoji Icons

### üìïHow to Use?

- In this version, when selecting icons for items, achievements, etc., you can now directly choose emoji expressions as icons.

## II. Second Wave of API Updates
![image-20250106212817689](./_media/198/image-20250106212817689.png)

Since the API functionality was opened in v1.90.0, we're delighted to see many users actively exploring and creating rich content based on the API. Many users started from scratch learning URL-related knowledge and successfully applied the API to create desktop widgets, DIY desktop clients, and even achieved web application integration, which is impressive.

However, due to complex data structures and substantial design and development workload, the first batch of APIs lacked some core functionalities, such as editing tasks, editing items, creating achievements with unlock conditions, and creating items with usage effects. The completion of these features continued until this version.

The design, development, testing, and updates of cloud, desktop clients, and API documentation brought exponentially growing workload, causing the development branch started several months ago to only complete development and testing now.

**But our efforts have borne fruit! Today, the API covers almost all core functionalities of LifeUp. By opening up the API, we hope to make LifeUp more than just an application, but an open platform where users can freely develop, extend, and customize their own gamification systems.**

### üìïHow to Use?

- For API usage methods, please refer to our documentation library - Directory - Open Interface section.
- Definitions of new API interfaces have been added to the documentation.

## III. Desktop Client: Archive Feature & Feelings

### Archive

![image-20250106212442295](./_media/198/image-20250106212442295.png)

You can now directly export or import backup files on the desktop client.

This will simplify the process of transferring data to other devices and recovery.

### Publish New Feelings

![image-20240927225309975](./_media/198/image-20240927225309975.png)

Now supports publishing new feelings from the desktop client, with full support for adding images and setting time features.

‚ö†Ô∏èNote: Editing feelings is not supported yet.

### Other Updates

- Optimized connection-related error messages and explanations: clearly indicating whether it's a network issue or due to LifeUp backend not running
- Support for viewing task details
- Support for API Token security validation (optional, requires LifeUp Cloud 2.0.0 version)
- Purchase logic now uses the new "purchase item API" instead of the previous "adjust item quantity API" + "adjust coin amount API". So it can now correctly handle purchase limit logic, maintaining consistency with the app.

This update also serves to demonstrate API capabilities through the desktop client, as all desktop client features are implemented through the API.

## IV. LifeUp Cloud Optimization

> LifeUp Cloud is a tool that exposes API as HTTP interfaces and serves as a bridge for desktop client connection.

![image-20250106212725277](./_media/198/image-20250106212725277.png)

We've made numerous optimizations based on feedback about LifeUp Cloud:

- Added status display to quickly detect why desktop client can't connect
- Added advanced settings
  - Allow cross-origin access: useful for accessing LifeUp Cloud's HTTP interfaces using web-based technologies
  - Allow custom service ports
  - Allow setting access tokens: optional security validation measure
- Optimized error return values and specifications for LifeUp Cloud's interfaces
- Optimized service discovery and HTTP service switch logic, desktop client's auto-detection should work better now

## V. Preview

Since this update brings relatively few non-API features, here's a preview of upcoming version content, including features currently under development:

- **Major Feature:** Repeatable achievements
- **Medium Feature:** Text readability optimization for custom backgrounds
  - Originally thought to be a small change, but turned out quite complex
- **Minor Feature:** Add complete and remind later actions to notifications
  - Originally planned to support persistent notifications, but abandoned as newer Android versions no longer support true persistence
