<h1 align="center" padding="100">ulives: Gamify Your Life on iOS! ✨</h1>

Hey LifeUp Adventurers! 👋

We're thrilled to announce the launch of **ulives**, a brand-new gamified task management app built from the ground up, exclusively for iOS! 🎉

For a long time, LifeUp has been helping users gamify their lives on Android. Now, we've taken the core concepts you love, reimagined them, and crafted a fresh experience optimized for the iOS ecosystem and its unique design style. Think of ulives not just as a port, but as a significant evolution! 🚀

## Your Familiar Friends: Core Features 👯

Many of the core gamification mechanics you know are here, ready to power your journey:

*   **✅ Tasks & Habits:** The bread and butter of your quest log.
*   **🛍️ Items & Shop:** Define your own rewards! Items can have special effects like granting/deducting EXP or Coins, or even opening a URL.
    *   *Loot Boxes and countdown timer effects are planned (coming soon)!* 🎁⏳
*   **🏆 Achievements:** Create milestones to celebrate your victories.
    *   *Auto-tracking unlock conditions (e.g., based on progress) are planned (coming soon)!* 📈
*   **📊 Attributes & Levels:** Fully customizable attributes to reflect your growth areas. Level them up by completing related tasks.
    *   *Customizable level-up models are planned (coming soon)!* 🧬
*   **✍️ Reflections:** A dedicated space to jot down notes and thoughts linked to your activities.

## What's New in ulives? 🤔

ulives introduces several exciting upgrades to make gamifying your tasks even more flexible and powerful:

*   **🎨 Fresh Design:** Built with modern iOS aesthetics for a native, fluid UI & UX.
*   **🪙 Flexible Currency System:** Forget fixed currencies! In ulives, *any* item can act as currency. Set up your reward system exactly how you want it – the possibilities are endless!
*   **⏰ Modern Reminders & Repeats:** Stay on track with multiple reminders per task and a modern, intuitive interface for setting up repeating tasks that fits your real-life schedule.
*   **📂 Enhanced Organization with Groups:** Beyond simple lists, ulives introduces **Groups**. Organize your tasks, shop items, and achievements into logical categories for a clearer overview and better management.
*   **⏭️ Clearer Task Cycles & Skip Option:** We've refined how tasks and periods work, making them more explicit. Plus, you can now officially 'skip' a task occurrence without breaking your streak or affecting stats negatively when life happens.
*   **📜 Unified Activity Log:** Track everything in one place! See completed tasks, unlocked achievements, rewards gained/lost, and quickly create linked Reflections.
*   **☁️ Offline First & iCloud Backup:** No login required. Your data stays on your device, with seamless iCloud backup and sync.

## 🌱 Early Version & Future Roadmap

As ulives is brand new (v1.0!), you might encounter some rough edges or bugs. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to polish the experience! 🙏

Here's a peek at what's **coming soon**:

*   🍅 Pomodoro Timer / Countdown feature
*   📈 Auto-tracking achievements
*   🎁 Loot Boxes for randomized rewards
*   📊 Statistics Module
*   👥 Multi-profile support
*   🤖 AI assistance (e.g., suggesting suitable rewards, generating task ideas)
*   🌐 Public Community Features (Long-term goal: shareable task/achievement blueprints, 'roadmaps')
*   📱 iOS Widgets
*   🏝️ Live Activities & Dynamic Island support
*   ⚡ Shortcuts integration
*   🧬 Customizable level-up models

**Important Notes:**

*   Due to ulives being a completely new app, **LifeUp data and premium licenses cannot be transferred**.
*   To support ongoing development, future expansions (like potential AI features ✨ and cool effects!), and hopefully transition to full-time work on our apps, the **price for ulives Premium is higher** than LifeUp's. We believe the enhanced features and dedicated iOS development justify this change.

## 🤓 Technical Tidbits

For those interested in the tech behind ulives: we built it using **Kotlin Multiplatform** for the core logic and **native SwiftUI** for the user interface.

This approach allows us to deliver a truly native iOS experience that feels right at home on the platform, while also enabling us to potentially share core logic across platforms in the future – maybe even bringing ulives to Android someday! 🤖➡️🍏

## Commitment to Both Platforms 💪

Don't worry, Android users! We remain committed to **maintaining and updating both LifeUp (Android) and ulives (iOS)** concurrently.

P.S. We're already working on exciting new features for LifeUp too, like repeatable achievements (e.g., unlocking every N levels of an attribute) – coming soon! 😉
