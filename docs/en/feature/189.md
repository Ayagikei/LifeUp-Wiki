## Tasks Tag

Just add [#tag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tag?src=hashtag_click) after your task to create a tag,
and click the tag to filter out all tasks under that tag

## Redesigned Icons and UI

Now you can add achievements with multiple unlock conditions, and you can view condition details in
the dialog.

## Limit using for exp reduction effects

You can now enable *Limit Using* for experience reduction effects.

If you do not have the required amount of experience while using an item, the app will prohibit you
from using the item.

This has the effect of using experience points for a type of currency.

## Repetitive tasks with no deadline

Now, the repetitive task supports the setting of "no deadline". These kinds of tasks will not be
overdue, and the time will be advanced only when actively completed or given up.

## What's next?

We plan to continue addressing some of the more common feedback needs in the next release.

For example, the night mode is adapted to the theme color, sub-tasks reward experience points and
commodities, and the purchase of commodities increases attribute level restrictions, etc.

At the same time, we will also investigate the feasibility of integrating Google Calendar in the
near future (but this feature may still need 2~3 versions before it goes live).

Since we are developing independently in our spare time, the above are only some near-term goals,
and the corresponding launch time is not guaranteed.

Follow us on Reddit or Twitter (@AppLifeUp) for more information.

If you have any questions or feedback, please remember to contact our email address anytime for
help.

Thanks also to everyone on Reddit for building and discussing. We will also try to publish more
English articles in the future.
