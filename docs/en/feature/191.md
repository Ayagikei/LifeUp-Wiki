## v1.91.0 - Status Widget, Custom Level Gradient, Simple Desktop

> [DEV] What's new in v1.91: Status Widget, Custom Level Gradient, Simple Desktop

> We are here to introduce the v1.91 update. Many thanks to the long-term maintainers of the LifeUp Reddit community! :D Sorry that we do not have enough resources to keep track of all communities, so we mainly handle feedback from üìß and GitHub. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact us at üì´[kei.ayagi@gmail.com](mailto:kei.ayagi@gmail.com) or submit an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/Ayagikei/LifeUp/issues).

Sorry for keeping everyone has been waiting for a long time. 

Due to various matters, the overall development and learning progress has been delayed since the end of the year. And with everyone's support, I also successfully updated my development equipment, and I set up a desktop computer. This makes our development, debugging, and releases more efficient.



Recently, we have finally returned to normal update status. Version 1.91 will bring some updates according to the previous "Development Roadmap". **v1.91 is being released gradually, if you haven't received the update, you need to wait for a while.**



We had planned to introduce an integrated Google Calendar in v1.91. However, we encountered many technical obstacles in the actual development process. In order to release more updates as soon as possible, we have temporarily decided to postpone it and focus on developing other features first before coming back to develop Google Calendar integration. We are sorry for the users who were expecting to see Google Calendar integration in v1.91. But we will continue to work on integrating Google Calendar.



By the way, we also tried something new: the development of a LAN desktop client. **But please note that the desktop client is still very rudimentary and dependent on mobile data.**

## üèÜWidget: New Status Widgets (First Batch)

![](_media\191\01.png)

This update brings a series of widgets related to properties and coins, including:

- Coins (Small, Large, Target)
- Property List (Small, Large)

And this is just the first batch, we will develop more widgets soon.

### üìùHow to use

Usually, long press or pinch the system launcher to add widgets.

## üìàAttributes: Custom Level Gradient

![](_media\191\02.png)



In version v1.91, you can customize your level gradient, which is the experience value required for each level.

You can choose higher challenges or smoother growth curves according to your preferences, now it's up to you.

If you just want to know the built-in level table, you can also go to that page to check it out.

### üìùHow to use

Sidebar - Settings - Advance - Custom Level

## ‚ú®Multi-Platform: Desktop

![](_media/191/05.png)

During this period, we also tried something new, and with the new API update, we made it possible to query various detailed list data.

We have developed a **fully open-sourceÔºàhttps://github.com/Ayagikei/LifeUp-DesktopÔºâ** LAN desktop software that can connect to your phone and display various list data, and supports some simple operations: purchase products, complete tasks, export reflection pictures and view them with the system picture browser.

The software theoretically supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS.



‚ö† Note that the desktop is still in the early development stage.

We will continue to maintain and add more functions, such as adding tasks through the desktop, adapting the interface for interaction, exporting reflections in markdown format, etc.

### üìùHow to use

For details, please see the "Sidebar-Settings-Labs-LifeUp Cloud" section.





## ‚úèÔ∏èAPI: Querying Full List Data and More APIS

![](_media/191/06.png)

**Data Interface**

As the data source foundation for the desktop client, we provide a complete data query interface in this version.

If you are an Android developer, you can use our **LifeUp SDK** to query various data in LifeUp app.

If you are any other type of developer, you can use the HTTP protocol to call the "LifeUp Cloud" API. This is also the practice on the desktop client.

If you don't know about development, don't worry:

1. First, now is the best learning opportunity.

2. Second, the above data APIs are open, which means that community developers can use this data for secondary development.

For example, they can design task list pages, shop pages, and perform more complex secondary development (such as discount, turnip buying and selling functions).

The results of secondary development can also benefit all users.



Specific interfaces will be added to the API documentation later.

**Other API Interface Improvements**

Additions

- ATM deposit and withdrawal
- Set "Disable Purchase" for items
- Set "Tag Color" for tasks
- Set ATM balance directly
- Simple query for specified item details
- Add a third button and operation option to the "confirm_dialog" interface

Behavior Changes

- confirm_dialog pop-up API, if the text or operation of some buttons is not provided, the button will not be displayed.

  This will provide higher flexibility in pop-up control, for example, you can set a text-only pop-up without buttons for displaying text and motivational language.

- penalty punishment API, in the past version, a maximum of 100 items can be deducted for goods, and now the limit has been expanded to 9 digits.

### üìù Usage

Check our API documentation and GitHub repository.

## üçÖTomato: Automatic Work and Rest Timing

![screely-1676558398757](_media/191/07.png)

This version will also introduce the automatic start of the Pomodoro clock function.

Please make sure that your phone has been **compatibility configured** to avoid the system interrupting the operation of the Pomodoro clock.

Note that after turning on "Automatic Start of Rest", the original additional countdown function will be disabled.

### üìù Usage

Go to the Tomato - Upper right corner settings page.

------



## üöÄOthers: Performance Optimization

Through user feedback and online data collection, we found that the efficiency of some data queries in the LifeUp application will be significantly reduced in the case of a large amount of data.

For a to-do list tool application, stability and long-term are crucial.

Therefore, in this version, we have made a series of optimizations for scenarios with a large amount of data. These optimizations can significantly improve the loading speed of most list pages (especially the to-do list page).

We will continue to optimize for these scenarios.
