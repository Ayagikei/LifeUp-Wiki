## I. üìã Task Templates

![image-20231023213616938](_media/193/image-20231023213616938.png)

This version introduces built-in task templates. It eliminates the need to create tasks indirectly using "Copy Task" and APIs.

When creating or editing tasks, users can save the current settings as templates.

In the future, when creating tasks, you can import previous reward settings, task settings, and more with a single click.

### üìï How to Use?

When creating or editing tasks, click the Task Templates button in the top bar.

Task templates will record most of your settings, but currently do not include the deadline.





## II. üé® Material You Theme

![image-20231023213849504](_media/193/image-20231023213849504.png)

This version fully adapts to the Material You design language (theme).

This design language is more modern and offers a cleaner appearance. It's also one of the officially promoted UI styles for the future.

Moreover, Material You's core feature is that "everyone can have a different theme color."

This allows "LifeUp" to introduce new mechanisms such as dynamic theme colors based on wallpaper and custom theme colors. (Note: Device support is required.)

### üìï How to Use?

As shown in the images above, open the sidebar, go to Settings, and click Display to adjust the related options.

If your device does not support dynamic theme colors, you can still choose from preset theme colors.

But if your device supports dynamic theme colors, you can enable this feature and customize your desired theme colors with high flexibility:
