The Google Play Store is our primary distribution channel. We recommend purchasing through Google Play for the best experience and most timely updates.

### 💫 1.1 Purchase from Google Play

With a Google Play purchase, you receive:

- **One-time Purchase for lifetime access to all features**
- A completely ad-free experience with no in-app purchases
- Regular updates and improvements
- A 7-day trial period after purchase with refund options
- Support for users in regions without Google Play payment access

If you need to gift a license to a friend or are in a region where Google Play payments are not supported, please contact us at lifeup@ulives.io for assistance.

#### Refund Policy
- Automatic refund available within hours of purchase through Google Play.
- Manual refund available within 7 days by contacting lifeup@ulives.io with your GPA order number.
- Please use the Gmail address associated with your purchase when requesting a refund.
- Refund requests cannot be processed more than 7 days after purchase.
- Note: Leaving a review on Google Play does not expedite the refund process.

### ⚡ Important Notes

While the standalone version APK can be downloaded directly from GitHub, please note:

- **A Google or Facebook login is required to bind your license.**
- We are working on alternative binding methods that don't require these login options, but they are not yet available.
- You need to stay logged in for license verification.
- This version requires a server connection for license validation.

After the trial period ends, you can:

1. Export your data and transfer it to the Google Play version.
2. Purchase a direct redemption code to continue using this version.

## 📱 3. Amazon Appstore Version

LifeUp Pro is also available as a paid app on the Amazon Appstore. Similar to the Google Play version, it offers:

- A One-time Purchase for permanent access
- An ad-free experience
- All features included
- Regular updates

**Important:** Amazon has announced the closure of its Android Appstore for non-Fire devices. We recommend that users with non-Fire devices purchase LifeUp through other channels, such as Google Play. Fire device users can continue to purchase and receive updates via the Amazon Appstore.

## ⚠️ 4. Warning About Cracked Versions

We have found some websites offering cracked versions of LifeUp. Using these versions comes with risks:

- No access to continuous updates and bug fixes
- Potential loss of user data with no export capability
- Risk of added advertisements or malicious permissions that may compromise your privacy
- Inability to log in properly or use online features

LifeUp is a One-time Purchase indie app. If you enjoy using it, please consider supporting our development work.
