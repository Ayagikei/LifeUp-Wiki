The application **will not apply for storage space read permission**, so it will not read any files that are not authorized by you.

The network access permission  is for access to the "WORLD" module, authorized login, and optional Dropbox/WebDAV synchronization and other functions.

The application has applied for the camera permission to facilitate the user to use image attachments, upload avatars and other functions, and **will be able to call the camera only after the user granted the permissions.**

The application also provides the function of writing events to the system calendar application to remind you. T**his function will require calendar read and write permissions, but this function is optional, and we will only read events written by the application itself.**

#### 1.3 Data Storage

**Only the content you actively share publicly in the "World" module will be stored on the server. And these contents all support deletion and destruction operations.**

For example, the team you created in the "World" module, the news published after joining the team after completing the task, the products that are actively shared, and so on.
