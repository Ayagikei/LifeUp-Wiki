# *LifeUp* App Privacy Terms & Policy

### 1. Personal Information

We do not collect personal information unless provided by users. 

For example your name, email address etc., where you have provided it for feedback or subscription purposes. We do not share these information with another party.

#### 1.1 User information (third-party authorization)

##### Google/Facebook Sign In

**Only after you confirm the authorization to log in,** we will create an account with the nickname
and profile picture you authorized to provide (and will not include information such as email
accounts).

##### Google Drive

Since Google Drive backups depend on email addresses, *LifeUp* will apply for email address
permission when you authorize Google Drive. **But this address will only be used locally, *LifeUp*
will not pass it to the application server and storage.**

And *LifeUp* only applies for app-specific storage, which means we don't have permission to access
your private files.

##### DropBox

After you authorize DropBox, **the relevant information will only be kept on your device for backup.
and is not passed to the application server.**

And *LifeUp* only applies **for app-specific storage, which means we don't have permission to access
your private files.**

##### WebDAV Server

**Your WebDAV URL, account, and password information will only be stored locally and will not be
sent to the application server.** And the password is stored encrypted in the database.

##### Offline Mode

***LifeUp* is also fully allowed in offline mode, just it can not access to the "world" module.**

#### 1.2 Permissions

#### Storage

The application **will not apply for storage space read permission**, so it will not read any files that are not authorized by you.

The application has applied for the camera permission to facilitate the user to use image attachments, upload avatars and other functions, and **will be able to call the camera only after the user granted the permissions.**

For example, when you select an attached image, we directly call the system's file storage framework to access it.

It will only authorize *LifeUp* the single file you select, we will not have permission to read other files.

At the same time, unless you actively share files outside the world module, they will only be stored locally and will not pass through the server.

#### Network

The network access permission is for access to the "WORLD" module, authorized login, and optional Dropbox/WebDAV synchronization and other functions.

#### Calendar

The application also provides the function of writing events to the system calendar application to remind you. 

**This function will require calendar read and write permissions, And this permission will require user authorization only when the user uses the corresponding function. And *LifeUp* will only read events written by the application itself.**


#### 1.3 Data Storage

**The application is an offline first application and does not have an build-in online synchronization function, so most of the data is stored locally on the user's mobile phone.**

For example, all the local tasks you created, all the feelings recorded, the achievements you designed, and the shop items.

**Only the content you actively share publicly in the "World" module will be stored on the server. And these contents all support deletion and destruction operations.**

For example, the team you created in the "World" module, the activities you published after completing the team tasks, the shop items that are actively shared, and so on.

#### 1.4 Performance data and crash reports

We use [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to collect
user performance data and crash reports to track and fix issues.

This performance data may include your device model, network status, instance ID, when the problem
occurred, and related pages, **but this data will not be associated with your user data **(Does not
include your nickname, user id, email address and any contact information, and will not collect the
content you enter and create) and will only be used to analyze the problem and improve performance.

And this data is only temporarily stored by Firebase and Sentry for a period of time, and we will
not share it with third parties.

#### 1.5 Data deletion

You can delete server remote data in the app by yourself in the Settings page.

The local data can be deleted directly by uninstalling the application.
