# Data Deletion Request for *LifeUp Pro*

## 1. Data Deletion in LifeUp Pro

LifeUp Pro users have the ability to delete their data independently within the app.

As LifeUp Pro is primarily an offline application, you can manage your data directly on your device.

To delete your data, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the 'Settings - Data Backup/Restore/Clear' page in the LifeUp Pro app.
2. Choose the specific data you wish to delete, such as tasks, item rewards, local thoughts, and offline mode data.
3. Confirm your action to permanently delete the selected data.

**Alternatively, uninstalling the LifeUp Pro app from your device will also result in the deletion of all locally stored data.**



## 2. Account Deletion in LifeUp Pro

Deleting your account in LifeUp Pro is a separate process from data deletion.

When you delete your account, it will remove:

- Your public posts, such as teams and updates, published on our servers.
- Your nickname and other personal information associated with your account.
- OAuth associations linked to your account.

**To delete your LifeUp Pro account, please follow the previously outlined steps:**

1. Navigate to the 'Settings - Data Backup/Restore/Clear' page.
2. Tap on the 'Delete Account' button at the bottom of the page.
3. Confirm your action to permanently delete your account and all associated information.

**If you are no longer using the LifeUp Pro app but wish to delete your account and personal data, please contact us at [lifeup@ulives.io](mailto:lifeup@ulives.io).**

Provide us with the necessary details related to your account, and our team will assist you with the deletion process.

We are committed to ensuring your privacy and will handle your request with the utmost care and confidentiality.



## 3. Third-Party Services

Similar to LifeUp Lite, LifeUp Pro integrates with third-party services such as Firebase for enhanced functionality. The data collected by these services is not personally identifiable and is managed in accordance with their privacy policies. This data is automatically scheduled for deletion after a certain period as per the third-party service policies.



## 4. Updates and Compliance

We continuously monitor and update our practices to align with the latest privacy laws and industry standards. This section of the Privacy Policy will be amended as necessary to accurately reflect our data management and deletion processes for LifeUp Pro users.
